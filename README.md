# Exploration of `content-visibility` CSS property

The [`content-visibility`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility) property provides control over when elements are rendered, some rendering steps can be skipped for elements that are not yet needed by an user. This can make the initial page load faster. I want to explore a range of scenarios to see the true effect on performance.

## Example 1 - Landing page

This is a tasteful landing page for the artist Ang√®le, designed/coded by Rafaela
Lucas.

<img src="img/angele.jpg" alt="screenshot overview of angele landing page" style="display:block;margin:.5rem auto;"/>

It is of typical size with 4 major sections. The main nav is hidden always and can be opened via a hamburger menu.It has some
JavaScript to make a slideshow widget as part of the hero section.

I think it is a good candidate for realistically testing what `content-visibility` can do for a typical webpage.

### Scenarios explored

I will test some scenarios to see the impact that the property can have
when applied to different parts of the page.

1. Default style.
1. Nav main menu has `content-visibility:auto` applied to it.
1. Nav main menu with `content-visibility:auto` and `content-intrinsic-size: 100vw 100vh;` specified.
1. Lower 3 sections have `content-visibility:auto` applied.
1. Lower 3 sections have `content-visibility:auto` and `contain-intrinsic-size` specified.
1. Lower 3 sections have `content-visibility:hidden` applied.
1. Lower 3 sections have `content-visibility:hidden` and `contain-intrinsic-size` specified.
1. Apply `content-visibility:auto` to hero section to see if a penalty is incurred. Don't repeat this!!

### Performance audit results
